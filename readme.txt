Adds clear float button to TinyMCE Editor.

== Description ==

This plugin adds 1 button to [TinyMCE](http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/) to clear floating elements. It also adds divs to valid tags so they won't be deleted if empty.

Originally by [Miguel Ibero](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tinymce-clear-buttons/).

== Installation ==

1. Download.
2. Unzip.
3. Upload to the plugins directory (wp-content/plugins).
4. Activate the plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why do you need to clear the floats? =
Well, sometimes you want to add two floating images but don't want them to overlap. Or you want to add an image floated to the left and text on the right, and then add a new block. You can add a clear in
the middle to achieve the desired effect.

= Where do I get support? =
Ask your question in the [Support Forums](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/clear-floats-button). Please note that due to restricted time availability we're not actively answering questions, unless a real bug is reported. See: "What should I try before reporting a bug" section.

= What should I try before reporting a bug? =
1. Disable all your plugins except "Custom Post Type Maker".
2. See if the plugin behaves normally with the default Wordpress theme.
3. Try to run the plugin on a clean Wordpress install.

If all of this fails, see: "How should I report bugs?" section.
